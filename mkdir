mkdir command -make directories.

The command mkdir stands for “make directory”. It creates each directory specifed on the command line in the order given. It reports an error if DIRECTORY already exists, unless the -p option is given.

The mkdir command in Linux/Unix allows users to create or make new directories (also referred to as folders in some operating systems).

This command creates the DIRECTORY(ies), if they do not already exist. This command can create multiple directories at once as well as set the permissions for the directories (folders).

It is important to note that for executing this command, users must have the right permissions to create a directory in the parent directory, otherwise the users would receive a ‘permission denied’ error.
